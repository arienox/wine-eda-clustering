# Wine Analysis
This code performs a basic analysis of the wine dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset contains 178 records and 13 attributes. The code performs the following steps:

Prints the shape of the data.
Finds and prints descriptive statistics of the data.
Plots a pairplot of the data to visualize correlations between variables.
Determines if the data is appropriate for factor analysis by calculating the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure.
Detects and visualizes any outliers present in the data.
Clusters the data into different classes of wine using Agglomerative Clustering and plots the results.
The code also includes comments explaining each step in more detail.
